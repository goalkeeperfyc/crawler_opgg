# crawler_opgg
This is a crawler system to get data about PUBG user information from www.op.gg.
In the future, I want to add a function to figure out how many percentage of cheating in PUBG.
It is a pretty complete crawler system. We can get data and write into database under the help of proxy pool. 
If the speed of the crawler is not satisfied, I will try to add mutilprocessing module.
